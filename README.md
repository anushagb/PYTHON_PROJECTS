# PYTHON_PROJECTS
Binary Search Program
Description
This Python program implements  binary search algorithms to efficiently find a target number in a sorted list of numbers.

# Usage
To use the program:


1.Run the script in a Python environment.

2.Follow the prompts to input a list of numbers separated by spaces and the target number to search for.

3.The program will output the search results and execution time for both naive and binary search algorithms.
